# InDaHood

## Project Description

InDaHood is a responsive online webpage for street clothing. It is fully functioning grabbing items from a json file database and with the ability to add and remove from cart producing your total. There is a contact form section and links to github, instagram etc.  

We built this using Tailwind and React and it's deployed on Netlify to practice the things we have learned in our studies.


## Challenges

We ran into some issues getting the cart working and some of the components some team members had built were not compatible with things others had done, so we had to do a lot of reworking, and working around these issues. We also had some inital issues with git and the work flow between us.

Overall it was a really good experience to work together to develop this.

## The Future

In the future we would like to add a filter button to filter items by tag names, sizes and type.
